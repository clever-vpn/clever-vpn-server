## Why Us?

### Overview
With our SaaS based allâ€‘inâ€‘one VPN service platform, you don't need any technical backgroundâ€”you can become a professional VPN service provider in just 5 minutes and deliver enterpriseâ€‘grade VPN services to your users. We are the first cloud provider to offer a SaaS platform specifically for VPN service providers.

### Who are we?
We are a geek team of experts in the Linux kernel and VPN protocols. By deeply integrating VPN protocols into the Linux kernel and deploying servers in clustered form, we have dramatically improved our antiâ€‘censorship capabilities and system stability. This solves the traditional VPN pain points of easy blocking and heavy maintenance burdens (especially frequent app updates to counter GFW blocking rules), making VPNâ€‘asâ€‘aâ€‘Service a reality. As a VPN service provider using our platform, you will significantly reduce hardware investment, R&D and maintenance costs, and greatly boost operational efficiency.

Our philosophy: focus on core technology, deliver stable and reliable Softwareâ€‘asâ€‘aâ€‘Service (SaaS), and eliminate redundant marketing and excess UIâ€”true value driven by technology.

### Our Advantages

#### VPN Protocol Kernel Integration
We are the first VPN provider to implement the VPN protocol directly in the Linux kernel. Our solution is simpler, faster, and more adaptive than others. Kernelâ€‘level innovation combined with cloudâ€‘based operations drives an exponential reduction in operating costs and heralds a revolution in the industry.

Our proprietary clustered VPN server technology features intelligent routing, automatic load balancing, regionâ€‘based node management, and support for millions of users.

#### Standardized & Openâ€‘Source Appsâ€”No Updates Required
By moving all VPN protocol logic to the cloud, our VPN apps are standardized and no longer need constant updates to counter GFW block rules. All our client apps are openâ€‘source on GitHub, enabling VPN service providers to whiteâ€‘label and customize them without maintaining a large app development team.

#### Microâ€‘Sized VPN Servers
Since our VPN protocol runs in the Linux kernel, efficiency is greatly improved. You can become a VPN service provider with a small, lowâ€‘cost VPS for just a few dollars a month.

#### Unmatched Circumvention Capabilities
Kernelâ€‘level implementation allows our VPN protocol to adapt dynamically to blocking tactics, delivering powerful antiâ€‘detection abilities. Enjoy 365â€‘day uninterrupted accessâ€”even on sensitive dates, you can bypass censorship with ease.
